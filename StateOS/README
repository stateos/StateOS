StateOS
---------
Free, extremely simple, amazingly tiny and very fast real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for deeply embedded applications.
Target: ARM Cortex-M, STM8 families.
It was inspired by the concept of a state machine.
Procedure executed by the task (task state) doesn't have to be noreturn-type.
It will be executed into an infinite loop.
There's a dedicated function for immediate change the task state.
