StateOS
---------
Free real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for deeply embedded applications.
It was inspired by the concept of a state machine.
---------
Features:
- kernel works in preemptive or cooperative mode
- kernel can operate in tick-less mode
- events
- flags (one, all)
- barriers
- semaphores (direct, binary, limited, counting)
- mutexes (normal, recursive, priority protect, priority inheritance)
- condition variables
- message queues
- mail box queues
- timers (one-shot, periodic)
- c++ wrapper
