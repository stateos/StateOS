StateOS
---------
Free, tiny and simple real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for deeply embedded applications.
Target: ARM Cortex-M family.
It was inspired by the concept of a state machine.
Procedure executed by the task (task state) doesn't have to be noreturn-type.
It will be executed into an infinite loop.
There's a dedicated function for immediate change the task state.
---------
Features:
- kernel works in preemptive or cooperative mode
- kernel can operate in tick-less mode (32-bit timer required)
- events
- flags (one, all, accept)
- barriers
- semaphores (binary, limited, counting)
- mutexes (normal, recursive, priority protect, priority inheritance)
- condition variables
- message queues
- mailbox queues
- timers (one-shot, periodic)
- c++ wrapper
- all documentation is contained within the source files
---------
1.2
- added new features for use in 'C' code only
- added examples (main.c.14-17) for some of new features
